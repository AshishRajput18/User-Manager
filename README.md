👤✨ User Management System ✨👤
🔍 Overview

🚀 This project is a User Management System developed using Java & Spring Boot with MySQL as the database.
It provides RESTful APIs to manage users and demonstrates core backend development concepts such as CRUD operations, validation, and exception handling.

🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to understand and implement:

⚙️ Building REST APIs using Spring Boot
🗄️ Performing database operations using Spring Data JPA
✅ Applying backend input validation
🛑 Handling errors in a clean and structured manner

📋 Functional Requirements

✔️ List all users
➕ Add a new user (Name, Email, Age)
✏️ Edit an existing user
❌ Delete a user
⚠️ Display validation error messages

🛠️ Technologies Used

☕ Java
🌱 Spring Boot
📦 Spring Data JPA
🐬 MySQL
🔗 Hibernate
🧰 Maven
📬 Postman

🏗️ Application Architecture

The project follows a layered architecture:

🎮 Controller Layer – Handles HTTP requests & responses
🧠 Service Layer – Contains business logic
🗃️ Repository Layer – Manages database interactions
📊 Entity Layer – Represents database tables

✅⚠️ Validation & Error Handling

🔒 Backend validation ensures invalid data is not saved
📏 Validation rules applied for Name, Email, and Age
🌐 Global exception handling returns meaningful error messages

🧪 API Testing

📬 All APIs are tested using Postman to verify:
✔ Request handling
✔ Validation
✔ Response structure

🎓 Use Cases

📘 Learning Spring Boot REST API development
🧪 Practicing CRUD operations with MySQL
💼 Preparing for Java Backend Interviews

🏁 Conclusion

✨ This project serves as a beginner-to-intermediate level example of building a RESTful backend application using Spring Boot & MySQL, following industry best practices.
